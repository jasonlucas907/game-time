Build a game that is playable in the browser.

#### Specifications

We want your game to be full-featured and playable â€” not just a proof of concept of the gameplay and rendering features.

To this end, make sure to include sufficient UX to allow the user to fully interact with the game. This would include:

* Indicate when the game is over and won or lost
* Allow the user to start a new game
* Include a clean UI surrounding the actual game interface itself
* Create multiple rounds of difficulty (consider increasing factors such as game speed, randomness of starting setup, etc.).

#### Tech Stack

You can use any of the following JavaScript libraries:

* jQuery
* Mocha
* Moment.js
* Numeral.js
